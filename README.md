===================

## This is the repo for the coursera Data Science Coursework.

### I hope to further my knowledge and apply this to my current projects.  The benefits desired are:

* Working knowledge of R
* Ability to get, clean and consume large data sets
* Using exploratory analysis, I intend to produce candidates for futher deep dives into causal analysis in my field.

## Thanks!
